This is my first attempt at a Madlibs style poetry game/generator. This README will be updated as I work through the project.

// notes for the future: I'd like to set up local storage for this so you can save your slams. I don't have time to implement that. 
// I have no idea what's wrong with the word based regex patterns. I can't seem to get them to trigger the right way. I've commented them out for the phrase-based answers.
// The template literals could use some tweaks. Most of the generated poems are clunky 
// I am not sure what else I could do with this apart from coming up with new poem styles and making the templates better.
// maybe a battle option where saved poems could be rated and a winner declared?
